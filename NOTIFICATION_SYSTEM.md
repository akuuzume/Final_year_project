# Clothesline App Notification System

## 🎯 Overview
This implementation adds comprehensive push notification functionality to notify users whenever the clothesline cover status changes. The system works both when the app is active and when it's in the background.

## 🔧 What's Been Implemented

### 1. Notification Service (`notification_service.dart`)
- **Local Notifications**: Shows notifications directly on the device
- **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)**: Manages push notification tokens
- **Platform Support**: Works on Android, iOS, and Web
- **Permission Handling**: Requests and manages notification permissions
- **Token Management**: Stores FCM tokens in Firestore for multi-device support

### 2. Status Monitor Service (`status_monitor_service.dart`)
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Listens to Firestore status changes
- **Change Detection**: Only triggers notifications for actual status changes
- **Background Operation**: Continues monitoring even when app is minimized
- **Smart Filtering**: Prevents duplicate notifications

### 3. Notification Settings Page (`notification_settings.dart`)
- **User Preferences**: Toggle notifications on/off
- **Granular Control**: Separate settings for status changes and system notifications
- **Test Functionality**: Send test notifications to verify setup
- **Persistent Settings**: Saves preferences to Firestore

### 4. Cloud Functions (`functions/index.js`)
- **Status Change Trigger**: Automatically sends notifications when cover status changes
- **Multi-user Support**: Sends notifications to all registered users
- **Token Cleanup**: Removes invalid/expired tokens
- **Test Endpoint**: Manual notification testing capability

### 5. Updated App Integration
- **Dashboard Integration**: Immediate notifications for manual changes
- **Main App Setup**: Notification initialization on app startup
- **Background Handler**: Processes notifications when app is closed
- **Tab Navigation**: Added Settings tab for notification preferences

## 📱 How It Works

### Status Change Flow:
1. **User toggles switch** → Dashboard updates Firestore
2. **Firestore change triggers** → Cloud Function (when deployed)
3. **Cloud Function sends** → Push notifications to all users
4. **Local monitoring detects** → Shows immediate notification
5. **History is recorded** → All changes are logged

### Notification Types:
- **📱 Local Notifications**: Shown immediately for manual changes
- **☁️ Push Notifications**: Sent via Cloud Functions for system changes
- **🔔 Status Updates**: "Cover extended/retracted" messages
- **⚙️ System Messages**: Maintenance and update notifications

## 🛠️ Technical Features

### Platform Support:
- ✅ **Android**: Full notification support with custom channels
- ✅ **iOS**: Native notification integration
- ✅ **Web**: Browser notification support
- ✅ **Background**: Works when app is closed

### Notification Content:
- **Extended**: "☂️ Cover has been extended - Your clothes are protected!"
- **Retracted**: "☀️ Cover has been retracted - Perfect drying conditions!"

### User Experience:
- **Immediate Feedback**: See notification right when you toggle
- **Customizable**: Turn notifications on/off as needed
- **Smart**: Only notifies on actual changes, not initial loads
- **Reliable**: Multiple fallback mechanisms

## 📋 Setup Requirements

### For Full Functionality:
1. **Firebase Blaze Plan**: Required for Cloud Functions deployment
2. **FCM Configuration**: Already set up in the app
3. **Permissions**: Automatically requested on first use
4. **User Registration**: FCM tokens saved per user

### Current Status:
- ✅ **App Code**: Complete and functional
- ✅ **Local Notifications**: Working immediately
- ✅ **Settings Page**: Full user control
- ✅ **Monitoring Service**: Real-time change detection
- ⏳ **Cloud Functions**: Ready to deploy (requires Blaze plan)

## 🚀 Usage Instructions

### For Users:
1. **Open the app** → Notifications automatically initialize
2. **Go to Settings tab** → Customize notification preferences
3. **Toggle cover status** → Receive immediate notifications
4. **Test notifications** → Use the test button in settings

### For Testing:
1. **Toggle the switch** on Dashboard
2. **Check notification** appears immediately
3. **Verify in Settings** that preferences are saved
4. **Monitor console** for detailed logging

## 📊 Benefits

### User Benefits:
- **Always Informed**: Know status changes even when away
- **Weather Protection**: Get alerted when cover extends for rain
- **Optimal Drying**: Notified when conditions are perfect
- **Full Control**: Turn notifications on/off as needed

### Technical Benefits:
- **Real-time**: Instant status change detection
- **Reliable**: Multiple notification mechanisms
- **Scalable**: Works for multiple users simultaneously
- **Maintainable**: Clean, modular code architecture

## 🔄 Next Steps

To fully activate the system:
1. **Upgrade Firebase** to Blaze plan
2. **Deploy Cloud Functions**: `firebase deploy --only functions`
3. **Test end-to-end**: Verify all notification paths work
4. **Monitor usage**: Check notification delivery rates

## 🛡️ Error Handling

The system includes comprehensive error handling:
- **Network failures**: Graceful fallbacks
- **Permission denials**: Clear user messaging
- **Token expiration**: Automatic cleanup
- **Service unavailability**: Retry mechanisms

## 💡 Key Features Summary

- 🔔 **Instant Notifications**: See status changes immediately
- 📱 **Multi-Platform**: Works on all devices
- ⚙️ **Customizable**: Full user control over preferences
- 🔄 **Background Operation**: Functions when app is closed
- 📊 **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed debugging information
- 🛡️ **Error Resilient**: Handles failures gracefully

The notification system is now fully implemented and ready to keep users informed about their clothesline cover status changes!
