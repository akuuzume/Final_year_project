# Google Sign-In Fix Guide

## Current Status
‚úÖ Code has been updated with detailed error logging
‚úÖ Android configuration is properly set up
‚úÖ Firebase configuration files are in place

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Main Issue: Missing SHA-1 Fingerprint

The most common cause of Google Sign-In failure is a missing SHA-1 fingerprint in Firebase Console.

## How to Fix:

### Method 1: Using Android Studio (Recommended)
1. Open your project in Android Studio
2. Click on **Gradle** tab (usually on the right side)
3. Navigate to: **android ‚Üí app ‚Üí Tasks ‚Üí android ‚Üí signingReport**
4. Double-click on **signingReport**
5. Look for the **SHA1** fingerprint in the output
6. Copy the SHA1 value (looks like: `AA:BB:CC:DD:...`)

### Method 2: Using Command Line (if available)
If you have Java/keytool installed:
```bash
keytool -list -v -alias androiddebugkey -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore -storepass android -keypass android
```

### Method 3: Using Flutter (Alternative)
```bash
cd android
./gradlew signingReport
```

## Adding SHA-1 to Firebase:

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Select your project: **clotheslinemobile**
3. Click on **Project Settings** (gear icon)
4. Go to **General** tab
5. Scroll down to **Your apps**
6. Find your Android app (`com.example.mobile_app`)
7. Click **Add fingerprint**
8. Paste your SHA-1 fingerprint
9. Click **Save**
10. **Download the updated google-services.json** file
11. Replace the existing file in `android/app/google-services.json`

## Testing:
After adding the SHA-1 fingerprint:
1. Clean and rebuild your app: `flutter clean && flutter pub get`
2. Run the app: `flutter run`
3. Try Google Sign-In - it should now work with detailed logging

## Debugging:
The updated code now provides detailed console logs with emojis:
- üîç Starting process
- ‚úÖ Successful steps
- ‚ùå Errors with specific causes
- üöÄ Navigation events

Check your Flutter console for these logs to see exactly where the process fails.

## Common Error Messages:
- "Failed to get ID token" = SHA-1 fingerprint missing
- "Network error" = Internet connection issue
- "PlatformException" = Google Play Services issue

## Your OAuth Client ID:
`19841551899-4j8l95t0t75m1j1oov0c6n5t2bmhqhfb.apps.googleusercontent.com`

This is already configured in your updated code.
